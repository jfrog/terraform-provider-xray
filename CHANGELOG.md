## 2.0.0 (September 27, 2023). Tested on Artifactory 7.68.11 and Xray 3.82.11

 BREAKING CHANGES:

 * resource/xray_operational_risk_policy: remove default values for attributes `op_risk_custom.release_date_greater_than_months`, `op_risk_custom.newer_versions_greater_than`, `op_risk_custom.release_cadence_per_year_less_than`, `op_risk_custom.commits_less_than`, and `op_risk_custom.committers_less_than`. They are now require to be defined explicitly if you wish to set any values. There may be state drifts for this policy resource as the provide code can't distinguish between default values vs configuration values so it can't automatically upgrade the TF state.

IMPROVEMENTS:

## 0.0.1 (Jan 4, 2022)

Xray provider was separated from Artifactory provider. The most notable differences in the new Xray provider:
- Provider uses Xray API v2 for all the API calls.
- HCL was changed and now uses singular names instead of the plurals for the repeatable elements, like `rule`, `watch_resource`, `filter` and `assigned_policy`.
- Security policy and License policy now are separate Terraform provider resources.
- In Schemas, TypeList was replaced by TypeSet (where it makes sense) to avoid sorting problems, when Terraform detect the change in sorted elements.
- Added multiple validations for Schemas to verify the data on the Terraform level instead of getting errors in the API response.

# xray_vulnerabilities_report (Resource)

Creates Xray Vulnerabilities report. The Vulnerabilities report provides information about vulnerabilities in your artifacts, builds, and release bundles. In addition to the information provided in the JFrog Platform on each of these entities, the report gives you a wider range of information such as vulnerabilities in multiple repositories, builds and release bundles. Criteria such as vulnerable component, CVE, cvss score, and severity are available in the report.

## Example Usage

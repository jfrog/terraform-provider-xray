# xray_security_policy (Resource)

Creates an xray policy using V2 of the underlying APIs. Please note: It's only compatible with Bearer token auth method (Identity and Access => Access Tokens

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "xray_security_policy" "min_severity" {
  name        = "test-security-policy-severity"
  description = "Security policy description"
  type        = "security"

  rule {
    name     = "rule-name-severity"
    priority = 1

    criteria {
      min_severity = "High"
    }

    actions {
      webhooks = []
      mails    = ["test@email.com"]
      block_release_bundle_distribution  = true
      fail_build                         = true
      notify_watch_recipients            = true
      notify_deployer                    = true
      create_ticket_enabled              = false // set to true only if Jira integration is enabled
      build_failure_grace_period_in_days = 5     // use only if fail_build is enabled

      block_download {
        unscanned = true
        active    = true
      }
    }
  }

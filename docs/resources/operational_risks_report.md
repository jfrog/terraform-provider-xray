      exclude_path_patterns = ["pattern2", "pattern2"]
    }

    repository {
      name                  = "reponame1"
      include_path_patterns = ["pattern1"]
      exclude_path_patterns = ["pattern3", "pattern4"]
    }
  }

  filters {
    component = "component-name"
    artifact  = "impacted-artifact"

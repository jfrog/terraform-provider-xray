# xray_operational_risks_report (Resource)

Creates Xray Operational Risks report. The Operational Risk report provides you with additional data on OSS components that will help you gain insights into the risk level of the components in use, such as; EOL, Version Age, Number of New Versions, and so on.  For more information, see [Components Operational Risk](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Components+Operational+Risk)

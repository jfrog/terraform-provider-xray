{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```sh
terraform import xray_watch.my-watch watch-name
```

### Import with `project_key`

To import watch that is in the scope of a project, you'll need to include the project key as part of the resource ID, separated by a colon (`:`).

For instance, using the following config during import:
```terraform
resource "xray_watch" "my-watch" {
  name        = "watch-name"
  project_key = "my-project"
}
```

Then use `terraform xray_watch.my-watch watch-name:my-project` to import the watch `watch-name` in the scope of project `my-project`.
